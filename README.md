===============

Object-relational mapping from JSON Schema data.

It's not perfect yet, but already working.

See [test data files](https://github.com/Sendanor/json-schema-orm/tree/master/tests/data) and how we use them in [our tests](https://github.com/Sendanor/json-schema-orm/blob/master/tests/test-build.js).
